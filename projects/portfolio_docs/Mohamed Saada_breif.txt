Step A: ABOUT ME PAGE
   My name is Mohamed Saada. I'm from the Middle East(half Iraqi &half Jordanian). I came to the USA 7 years ago and have lived here in San Francisco for the last five. I love this city and exploring all of the unique areas.The Mission is one of my favorites. Over the last year I have found a love of running and I like to run every day about 2-3 miles.
I have worked with computers for the majority of my life. I enjoy working on coding and researching application development. I have worked on developing apps for Android devices.  

  

Growing up as the oldest of five children, my parents relied on me to be an example for my siblings. My entire life has been one in which I am trying to be a positive influence not only for my siblings but my friends. I am good at being diplomatic and listening to both sides of an argument before making any judgments.   

  

I enjoy very much working with a team.  I feel I am more successful in a group because I believe in collaboration and sharing of ideas produces the best results.
