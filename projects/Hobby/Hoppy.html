        <h3>Running means a lot to me </h3>
        because it helps improve my mood and
        keep negative thoughts out of my mind.
        I have found running to be very meditative and calming
        Additionally, running has helped me lose weight and stay healthy

        <h2>instruct running</h2>
        In order to start running as a hobby, there are some key things you should do.
        The first would be to run or run/walk 20-30 minutes a day, two days a week.
        As well, it would be a good idea to take a long run or run/walk on the weekends, about 40 minutes to an hour.
        Ideally, you would run at a conversational pace, which means you aren't so out of breath that you can't talk to someone.
        Consider taking regular walk-breaks throughout your week,
        and on rest days, cross-train to build<span>
